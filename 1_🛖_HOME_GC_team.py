    Gang Chen Lab is a cutting-edge research laboratory in Whenzhou Medical University. 
    We have long focused on liver and gallbladder science. Discovering the mechanisms behind diseases. Providing best treatment for patients.
    The research areas of the mentor team members are related to basic research in hepatobiliary surgery, gastrointestinal malignancies, 
    transplantation immunology, experimental surgery, experimental diagnostics, treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and the role of environmental and genetic interactions on tumorigenesis and development. He has also worked in the field of basic and translational medicine for liver cancer. He has made a series of research achievements in the field of basic and translational medicine of liver cancer: 1. Basic research 1. In basic research, we have demonstrated the important role of SUL F2-TGF Î² 1-SMAD-POSTN signaling pathway in the process of hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis, and We have clarified the molecular mechanism of the nesting of hepatocellular carcinoma neovascularization by endothelial progenitor cells of bone marrow origin, and clarified the molecular mechanism of the long-chain chain angiogenesis.
    We clarified the molecular mechanism of long-stranded non-coding RNA-TUC338 in the drug resistance process of sorafenib hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma stem cells can influence the malignant potential of surrounding hepatocellular carcinoma cells by secreting exosomes. 2. In terms of translational medicine, we have established a platform for individualized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma based on genome sequencing and tissue drug sensitivity assay, and a PDX model of hepatocellular carcinoma.
    We have established a new model for individualized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and the first PDX model of bile duct cancer with high PLVAP expression. 3. In terms of clinical research, relying on the large number of liver cancer patients in hepatobiliary surgery, we have established a database of clinical data containing more than 2,200 cases of liver cancer and more than 240 cases of bile duct cancer. We have established a database of clinical data containing more than 2,200 cases of liver cancer and 240 cases of bile duct cancer, including complete follow-up data, and cooperated with Mayo Medical Center and Stanford University Medical Center in the United States. We have developed clinical cooperation with Mayo Medical Center and Stanford University Medical Center to share the clinical information of liver cancer patients. 
    Gang Chen Lab is one of the leading liver and gallbladder Lab in the world, and strives to make significant contributions to science and society.
